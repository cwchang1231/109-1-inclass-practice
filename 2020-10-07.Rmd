## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
heightsOftheEntireClassroom <- c()

heightsOftheEntireClassroom2 <- c()
```

```{r}
heightOfAStudentComingInsideTheClassroom <- sample(165:200,1)
```

```{r}
# method 1: concatenate 
heightsOftheEntireClassroom <-
  c(
    heightsOftheEntireClassroom,
    heightOfAStudentComingInsideTheClassroom
  )
```

```{r}
# method 2: 
heightsOftheEntireClassroom2 <-
  heightOfAStudentComingInsideTheClassroom
```

```{r}
char1<-"你好"
char2<-'你好'
```

```{r}
char1Vector<-c("你好","How are you?")
```

```{r}
cat("老師說換行要寫'\\n')
```
